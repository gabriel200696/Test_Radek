Visual Studio Code 2022 software was used to create the requested script. To execute it, just run the project, or use the main.c file (located in the Questao_3 directory) in another compiler of your choice.

The script is a routine that prints each number from 1 to 100 on a new line.
	-For each multiple of 3, print "Foo" instead of the number.
	-For each multiple of 5, print "Baa" instead of the number.
	-For multiple numbers simultaneously of 3 and 5, print "FooBaa", 	instead of the number.
