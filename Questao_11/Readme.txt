The string to be inverted must be changed manually, modifying the variable s on line 23. Where assuming that the bitwise XOR operator can be used to swap two variables, the same is used to invert the string. This is because XORing two numbers x and y returns a number that has all bits as 1 whenever the bits of x and y are different, so with 3 iterations but without using random variables two characters in the string can be swapped places.
